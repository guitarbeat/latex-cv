## 2026-01-16 - [PDF Metadata Accessibility]
**Learning:** `pdfinfo` is insufficient for verifying PDF viewer preferences like `pdfdisplaydoctitle` and `pdfstartview`. These settings reside in the PDF Catalog dictionary and, if the PDF is compressed (standard for `xelatex`), cannot be verified via simple `grep` or `strings` checks. The most reliable verification in a headless environment is checking the `.log` file for package confirmation or using advanced tools like `qpdf` (if available) to uncompress the file.
**Action:** When implementing PDF accessibility features, verify implementation by checking the LaTeX build logs for confirmation from packages like `hyperref`, rather than relying solely on post-build binary inspection.
