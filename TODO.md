# TODO for LaTeX CV Repository

- [ ] Compile `CV.tex` to produce `build/CV.pdf` and ensure that the resulting PDF matches `CV_original.pdf` visually and in layout.
- [ ] Review the compiled PDF for any formatting errors (e.g., misaligned sections, missing or incorrect symbols) and adjust the LaTeX source as needed.
- [ ] Keep the LaTeX file updated with any new experience, publications, or achievements to maintain an up-to-date CV.
- [ ] Consider automating the compilation process using a GitHub Action or continuous integration workflow so that `build/CV.pdf` is automatically regenerated on every commit.
