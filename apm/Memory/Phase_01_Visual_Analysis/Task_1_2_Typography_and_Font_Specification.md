# Task Log: Task 1.2 - Typography and Font Specification

## Summary
Created comprehensive typography specifications based on visual analysis findings from Task 1.1, providing detailed LaTeX implementation guidance for all text elements in the CV document.

## Details
Analyzed typography patterns across four key areas: heading hierarchy, body text specifications, special typography elements, and formatting patterns. Extracted specific LaTeX commands and configurations from existing implementations to create detailed specifications for font families, sizes, weights, spacing, and special formatting elements.

## Output
- **Typography Specification Document:** `/Users/aaron/Downloads/latex-cv/Typography_Specification.md`
- **Font Specifications:** Complete font stack with fallback hierarchy (Calibri → Helvetica → Arial → TeX Gyre Heros)
- **Heading Hierarchy:** 4-level typography system with specific LaTeX implementations
- **Body Text Specifications:** Line spacing (1.15), alignment, and paragraph formatting
- **Special Typography:** Bold/italic usage patterns and special formatting elements
- **Spacing Specifications:** Precise measurements for sections, lists, and content spacing
- **Implementation Guidelines:** Complete LaTeX code examples and quality assurance checklist

## Issues
None - All typography specifications completed successfully.

## Important Findings
**Critical Typography Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Font Hierarchy:**
   - Primary: Calibri with systematic fallback to Helvetica/Arial/TeX Gyre Heros
   - Sans serif fonts for headings with bold/italic variants
   - 12pt base font size with 1.15 line spacing

2. **Heading System:**
   - 4-level hierarchy: Major sections (all caps + rule), job titles (bold), institutions (regular), dates (italic)
   - Custom `\sectionheading{}` command with gray horizontal rule
   - Consistent spacing: 1.2ex before, 0.3ex after title, 0.6ex after rule

3. **Special Formatting:**
   - Bold for names, job titles, degrees, awards, author names
   - Italic for dates, GPAs, journal names, departments, poster titles
   - Size variations: `\large` for headings, `\small` for footer/citations

4. **Spacing System:**
   - Bullet points: 0.5ex topsep, 0pt itemsep, 1.25em left margin
   - Content spacing: 0.8ex for publications, 0.6ex for sections, 0.4ex for lists
   - Alignment: `\hfill` for right alignment, `\newline` for line breaks

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 1.3: Layout and Spacing Specification
- Use typography specifications as foundation for layout implementation
- Reference font and spacing specifications for accurate CV replication
