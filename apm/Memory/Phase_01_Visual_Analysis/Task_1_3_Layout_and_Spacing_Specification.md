# Task Log: Task 1.3 - Layout and Spacing Specification

## Summary
Created comprehensive layout and spacing specifications based on visual analysis findings from Task 1.1 and typography specifications from Task 1.2, providing detailed LaTeX implementation guidance for all document structure elements.

## Details
Analyzed layout patterns across four key areas: document margins and page layout, section and subsection spacing patterns, list formatting and bullet point specifications, and content organization. Extracted specific LaTeX commands and configurations from existing implementations to create detailed specifications for margins, spacing, alignment, and structural layout.

## Output
- **Layout Specification Document:** `/Users/aaron/Downloads/latex-cv/Layout_Specification.md`
- **Page Geometry:** Precise margin specifications (1" top/bottom, 0.75" left/right)
- **Header/Footer Layout:** Two-column header with contact info, right-aligned footer
- **Tabular Layouts:** Two-column content layouts (78% content, 21% dates)
- **Section Spacing:** 6-level spacing hierarchy from 1.3ex to 0.3ex
- **List Formatting:** Bullet point configuration with 1.25em indentation
- **Implementation Guidelines:** Complete LaTeX code examples and quality assurance checklist

## Issues
None - All layout and spacing specifications completed successfully.

## Important Findings
**Critical Layout Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Page Geometry:**
   - Asymmetric margins: 1" top/bottom, 0.75" left/right
   - Standard letter size (8.5" × 11") with 12pt article class
   - Professional appearance with print compatibility

2. **Header Structure:**
   - Two-column tabular with name left, contact right
   - Flexible spacing with `\extracolsep{\fill}`
   - Address block left-aligned with 1.3ex spacing after contact

3. **Tabular Layouts:**
   - Content column: 78% width, Date column: 21% width
   - Flexible layouts with `\extracolsep{\fill}` for automatic spacing
   - Right-aligned dates and locations throughout

4. **Spacing Hierarchy:**
   - 6-level system: 1.3ex (header) → 1.2ex (sections) → 0.8ex (publications) → 0.6ex (standard) → 0.4ex (lists) → 0.3ex (titles)
   - Consistent spacing patterns across all content types
   - Section headers with gray horizontal rules (0.3pt, 98% width)

5. **List Formatting:**
   - Bullet configuration: 1.25em left margin, 0.5em label separation
   - Minimal spacing: 0.5ex topsep, 0pt itemsep
   - Consistent indentation and alignment patterns

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 1.4: Design Specification Document Creation
- Use layout specifications as foundation for complete design implementation
- Reference spacing and layout specifications for accurate CV replication
