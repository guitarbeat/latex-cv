# Task Log: Task 2.1 - LaTeX Document Structure Setup

## Summary
Successfully established foundational LaTeX document structure with proper document class, packages, and complete formatting setup based on comprehensive design specifications from Phase 1.

## Details
Integrated all design specifications from Complete_Design_Specification.md, Typography_Specification.md, and Layout_Specification.md to create complete LaTeX document structure. Implemented proper document class, all required packages, custom formatting commands, environments, and complete document structure with all 12 major sections and content.

## Output
- **Complete LaTeX Document:** `/Users/aaron/Downloads/latex-cv/CV_Enhanced.tex`
- **Document Class:** 12pt article with proper page geometry (1" top/bottom, 0.75" left/right margins)
- **Package Configuration:** All required packages for typography, layout, formatting, and document structure
- **Font Configuration:** Complete font fallback hierarchy (Calibri → Helvetica → Arial → TeX Gyre Heros)
- **Custom Commands:** Section heading command, custom tabular environments, bullet configuration
- **Complete Document Structure:** All 12 major sections with proper formatting and content organization
- **Header/Footer Setup:** Two-column header with contact info, right-aligned footer with name and page

## Issues
None - All design specifications successfully implemented in LaTeX document structure.

## Important Findings
**Complete LaTeX Document Structure Implementation:**

1. **Document Foundation:**
   - 12pt article class with asymmetric margins (1" top/bottom, 0.75" left/right)
   - Complete package configuration for typography, layout, formatting, and document structure
   - Font fallback hierarchy with cross-platform compatibility

2. **Typography Implementation:**
   - Complete font stack: Calibri → Helvetica → Arial → TeX Gyre Heros
   - Custom section heading command with gray horizontal rules
   - Proper bold/italic usage patterns for all content types
   - 1.15 line spacing (Word-like leading)

3. **Layout Implementation:**
   - Two-column header structure with flexible spacing
   - Custom tabular environments for consistent 78%/21% column layouts
   - Bullet point configuration with 1.25em indentation
   - 6-level spacing hierarchy implementation

4. **Custom Commands and Environments:**
   - `\sectionheading{}` command with proper spacing and gray rules
   - `contenttabular`, `flexibletabular`, `headertabular` environments
   - Bullet point configuration with minimal spacing
   - Special character handling for Unicode compatibility

5. **Complete Document Structure:**
   - All 12 major sections implemented with proper formatting
   - Header section with two-column contact layout
   - Education, Publications, Research Experience, Funding, Appointments, Teaching, Awards, Posters, Service, Professional Experience, Conference Participation
   - Proper spacing, alignment, and typography throughout

## Next Steps
- LaTeX document structure setup: COMPLETED
- Document ready for compilation and testing
- All design specifications successfully implemented
- Ready for typography and layout refinement if needed
