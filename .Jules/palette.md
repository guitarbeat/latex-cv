## 2024-05-22 - PDF Accessibility & UX
**Learning:** Even in non-web formats like PDF, metadata (title, author, language) is critical for accessibility (screen readers) and user experience (browser tab titles). Adding hyperlinks to contact info significantly reduces friction for recruiters.
**Action:** Always check `\hypersetup` in LaTeX projects for missing metadata and ensure URLs/emails are clickable `\href`s, not just text.
